# We're going to identify the depth in regions that the pacbio contigs map to
# Start by getting the sex chromosome pacbio contigs
# And identifying their coordinates in the final assembly
# This will allow us to use the old alignment and skip the mapping step

# In the original nomenclature, the sex chromosome scaffold is Scaffold_8
# We're going to get the contigs that were assembled into the sex chromosome
# Map them to the final assembly
# And extract depth information about those regions

# Get the contigs

# Looks like even pacbio contigs show haploid and diploid regions. Although the Y chromosome appears to have a region homologous to the X (based on karyotype) it's probably been shuffled around by transposon/repeat proliferation. Male-only data will probably not be enough for this.
